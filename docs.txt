'''
Generic class Pool<R> implements "smart" resource pool for an abstract class R which should extend class Resource and implement open() and close()
This implementation features:
* On-demand resource opening
* Resource recycling (close) based on:
   * Max idle time
   * Max open time
   * Max usage count

   After this initialization, the clients that use the pool must be 'good citizens', i.e. 'take' must precede corresponding 'put', and there
   must be exactly one 'put' per each 'take', and they should put back resources in consistent state, open or closed.
